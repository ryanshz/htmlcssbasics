# odinlanding
This project is meant to act as a culmination of my HTML and CSS skills.

For the last few weeks, I began to use the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to further expand my coding knowledge into Web Development. With the next portions of the course being focused on JavaScript and Ruby on Rails, I decided to create a seperate repository to showcase the growth of my knowledge so far.

## source images
These are the images I based my landing page on.

![Image of the landing page format](/design-images/design.png)
![Image of the landing page colors, fonts, and sizes](/design-images/color-fonts.png)

The first shows the general layout, which I did my best to recreate, while the second details the fonts I will use, which are exact. The landing page isn't exactly the same as the one provided, but it is very similar.
