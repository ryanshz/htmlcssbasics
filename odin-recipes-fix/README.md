This webpage has four coded HTML files, with three acting as recipe pages, located in the 'recipes' folder, and the index acting as a nagivation page.
The recipes were sourced from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).

This served to help me put into practice the concepts learned in the last lessons using HTML and combine them all into one project.
It was basic and foundational, but helped reinforce the concepts.

The initial project is [odin-recipes](/odin-recipes/), which only used HTML.
The project was later updated using CSS, which is shown in the [odin-recipes-with-css](/odin-recipes-with-css/) file.
