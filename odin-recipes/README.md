In this specific project, I created four seperate webpages. 
Three of the pages were individual recipes, each pulled from a recipe website and given images and listed steps.
The last page served as a directory page, linking to the other three recipes.

This served to help me put into practice the concepts learned in the last lessons using HTML and combine them all into one project.
It was basic and foundational, but helped reinforce the concepts.
