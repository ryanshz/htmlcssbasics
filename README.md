Compilation of all the HTML/CSS concepts I began learning.

These concepts were provided by the Odin Project, which I will be using throughout the next few weeks to learn full stack development.

My goal is to become adept at HTML and CSS, and learn JavaScript and Ruby on Rails afterward. With this knowledge, I plan to use it to develop new skills in my field and futher my career.
